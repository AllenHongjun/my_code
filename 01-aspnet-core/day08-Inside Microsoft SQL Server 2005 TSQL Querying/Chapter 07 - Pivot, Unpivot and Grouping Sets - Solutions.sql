-- All exercises for this chapter will involve querying the Orders
-- table in the tempdb database that you created and populated 
-- earlier by running the code in Listing 7-1

-- 1
-- Write a query against the Orders table that returns a row for each
-- employee, a column for each order year, and the count of orders
-- for each employee and order year

-- Desired output:
empid       cnt2007     cnt2008     cnt2009
----------- ----------- ----------- -----------
1           1           1           1
2           1           2           1
3           2           0           2

-- Solutions

-- Using standard solution
USE tempdb;

SELECT empid,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN orderyear = 2007 THEN orderyear END) AS cnt2007,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN orderyear = 2008 THEN orderyear END) AS cnt2008,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN orderyear = 2009 THEN orderyear END) AS cnt2009  
FROM (SELECT empid, YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear
      FROM dbo.Orders) AS D
GROUP BY empid;

-- Using the native PIVOT operator
SELECT empid, [2007] AS cnt2007, [2008] AS cnt2008, [2009] AS cnt2009
FROM (SELECT empid, YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear
      FROM dbo.Orders) AS D
  PIVOT(COUNT(orderyear)
        FOR orderyear IN([2007], [2008], [2009])) AS P;

-- 2
-- Run the following code to create and populate the EmpYearOrders table:
USE tempdb;

IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.EmpYearOrders', 'U') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE dbo.EmpYearOrders;

SELECT empid, [2007] AS cnt2007, [2008] AS cnt2008, [2009] AS cnt2009
INTO dbo.EmpYearOrders
FROM (SELECT empid, YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear
      FROM dbo.Orders) AS D
  PIVOT(COUNT(orderyear)
        FOR orderyear IN([2007], [2008], [2009])) AS P;

SELECT * FROM dbo.EmpYearOrders;

-- Output:
empid       cnt2007     cnt2008     cnt2009
----------- ----------- ----------- -----------
1           1           1           1
2           1           2           1
3           2           0           2

-- Write a query against the EmpYearOrders table that unpivots
-- the data, returning a row for each employee and order year
-- with the number of orders
-- Exclude rows where the number of orders is 0
-- (in our example, employee 3 in year 2008)

-- Desired output:
empid       orderyear   numorders
----------- ----------- -----------
1           2007        1
1           2008        1
1           2009        1
2           2007        1
2           2008        2
2           2009        1
3           2007        2
3           2009        2

                    UNION ALL SELECT 2009) AS Years) AS D
WHERE numorders <> 0;

-- Using the native UNPIVOT operator
SELECT empid, CAST(RIGHT(orderyear, 4) AS INT) AS orderyear, numorders
FROM dbo.EmpYearOrders
  UNPIVOT(numorders FOR orderyear IN(cnt2007, cnt2008, cnt2009)) AS U
WHERE numorders <> 0;

-- 3
-- Write a query against the Orders table that returns the 
-- total quantities for each:
-- employee, customer, and order year
-- employee and order year
-- customer and order year
-- Include a result column in the output that uniquely identifies 
-- the grouping set with which the current row is associated

-- Desired output:
groupingset empid       custid orderyear   sumqty
