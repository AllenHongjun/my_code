# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 32, Web API

This chapter contains these samples:

* Book Service Sample (offering in-memory data from a Web API service using ASP.NET Core)
* Book Service Async Sample (similar to the Book Service Sample, but offering async methods from the controller and use EF Core 2 )
* Book Service Client App (making use of the HttpClient and JSON.NET to access the Web API services)
* Azure Function hosting a Web API

The Book Service Sample makes use of Swagger.

An OData sample will follow
The OData Library for .NET Core is still not available on NuGet. I'm planning to have a sample when .NET Core 2.0 is available - and hopefully ODAta as well. [See](https://github.com/OData/WebApi/tree/feature/netcore "OData WebAPI")

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install

* Visual Studio 2017 Update 5 with the .NET Core workload

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).
