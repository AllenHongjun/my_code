To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install one of these tools:

* Visual Studio 2017 Update 5 with the .NET Core workload and the Universal Windows Platform development workload
* Visual Studio for Mac

The AsyncWindowsApp requires Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2017 with the Universal Windows Platform development workload. The other samples run on other platforms as well.
