# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 31, ASP.NET Core MVC

This chapter contains these samples:

* MVCSampleApp (core features for ASP.NET Core MVC)
* MenuPlanner (data access using EF Core)
* AzureADB2CSample (authentication with Azure AD B2C)
* RazorPagesSample (Razor Pages)

With ASP.NET Core 2.1 the AccountController and views are no longer created with the project. Instead, a UI library is used. Read [ASP.NET Core Identity Pages with ASP.NET Core 2.1](https://csharp.christiannagel.com/2018/07/18/identitypages/) for more information.

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install one of these tools:

* Visual Studio 2017 Update 8 with the .NET Core workload
* Visual Studio for Mac
* Visual Studio Code

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).
