# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 27, Localization

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* NumberAndDateFormatting (localized format strings)
* SortingDemo (sorting with different cultures and using the invariant culture)
* CreateResource (using `ResourceReader` and `ResourceWriter`)
* UWPCultureDemo (showing all cultures and regions with a UWP application)
* ResourcesDemo (accessing resources using `ResourceManager`)
* WebApplication (using `CultureInfo` and `IStringLocalizer` with ASP.NET Core)
* ASPNETCoreMVCSample (localizing with controllers, views, and data annotations)
* UWPLocalization (localizing with UWP and XLF)

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install one of these tools:

* Visual Studio 2017 Update 5 with the .NET Core workload
* Visual Studio for Mac
* Visual Studio Code

The UWPLocalization and UWPCultureDemo samples needs Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2017 with the Universal Windows Platform development workload. The other samples can be used on other platforms.
The UWPCultureDemo uses a TreeView control. This sample has been updated with Windows 10 April 2018 Update (version 1803) and no longer uses the C++ sample TreeView, but you need at least Windows 10 April 2018 Update.

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).
