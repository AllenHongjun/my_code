This zip contains code from every chapter with the exception of those chapters that contain no code.
With chapters where a database is accessed, a database backup file with the file extension .bak is included with the source code. You can 
restore this database using SQL Server Management Studio.
We hope you have fun with the sample code we have included and that you find it useful and informative. Enjoy.
